{"pageProps":{"postData":{"id":"rom-patching","contentHtml":"<p>Much of the information and utilities are out of date for applying patches to ROMs. If you're trying to apply a translation, hack, or modification as UPS files to a Gameboy Advance ROM you can follow these instructions.</p>\n<h1>Tools</h1>\n<p>If you're like me you probably stumbled onto the directions for patching while trying to build a <a href=\"http://mother3.fobby.net/or/\">Mother 3 fan translated ROM</a>. These directions are out of date and the <code>mother3_linux</code> utility does not work in Ubuntu 22.04. You'll also see a suggestion to use <a href=\"https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/519/\"><em>byuu's tsukuyomi UPS utility</em></a>, but I was not able to get this to work either.</p>\n<p>Instead, we're going to use <a href=\"https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/677/\"><em>upset</em></a> which presents itself as a replacement for <em>Tsukuyomi</em>. Download the tool from ROMHacking and unzip its contents. The tool works by applying the UPS patch \"which are binary diffs between two files\". The source code is provided in the zip file if you are curious how this is working under the hood, or if you'd like to build it yourself.</p>\n<h1>Using <em>upset</em> to patch ROMs</h1>\n<ol>\n<li>Open your terminal and navigate to the directory with the contents of the <code>upset.zip</code> file.</li>\n<li>Run <code>./upset</code> to bring up the <em>upset</em> GUI.</li>\n<li>Set the <em>Source file</em> to the UPS patch you are going to apply.</li>\n<li>Set <em>Target file</em> to the ROM file you are patching.</li>\n<li>Press <em>Ok</em></li>\n</ol>\n<p>If all goes well your ROM file should now have the UPS patch applied.</p>\n","title":"Applying patches to ROMs in Linux","date":"2022-12-14"}},"__N_SSG":true}
